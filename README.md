This is a project that runs a simulation of trucks delivering boxes to a warehouse, unloading those boxes, marking the cargo cost of each cost, the names of the drivers of the truck, and which company that driver works for.
Then the program saves that information, and exports it to an excel (cve) file that can be easily inspected.
